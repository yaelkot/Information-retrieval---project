# Information-retrieval-project

In the project we build a search engine for Wikipedia pages.
The search engine including:
* Reader
* Parser
* Indexer
* Posting Index
* Inverted Index
* Searcher
* Ranker

You can see the methods: Search, Search_body, Search_title, Search_anchor, get_page_rank, get_page_view.                                                                 
In each description of them there are how to send queries to the engine.
